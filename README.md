ideas for code improvement:
many message senders have common features, such as incrementing the message id counter and enqueing a produced message, maybe a decorator that reduces code reuse?

echo "This is my data" > /dev/udp/127.0.0.1/12001

test to see if game is recieving worked, so somehow player isn't sending

echo "This is my data" > /dev/udp/127.0.0.1/12018
