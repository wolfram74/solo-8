problem:
	several places have redundant code
		the runners are very similar in many ways
			all have a loop checking
				socket for new data
				outbox for things to send
				persistent messages to resend
			initialize the salient object
		the main objects have a number of similarities
			keep track of last message ids
			have a send_ack route
			have an ack method
		many routes have a few properties that are always exhibit
routes need to be re-written to take advantage of route-decorator
possible solution at object and runner level:
	a parent controller class with
		a class method #start_loop
		init that sets up
			last_message_id
